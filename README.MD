## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

To get started with **Monolog**, follow these steps:

### 1. Install project CLI

```bash
composer require devmboo/monolog
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd your-project-directory
```

### 3. Install dependencies using Composer

Ensure that you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. If you don't have it, you can install it by following the instructions on the official website.

```bash
composer install
```

This will install all the required dependencies for the project.

### 4. Install front-end dependencies (Tailwind CSS)

Monolog uses Tailwind CSS for styling. To install the required NPM packages, run the following:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install Tailwind and other necessary front-end dependencies.

### 5. Configure the `.env` file

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary configuration details:

```
#### APPLICATION ####
APP_KEY= 
APP_LOCAL=homolog
APP_URL=http://localhost
APP_NAME=monolog
APP_PORT=8000

#### DATABASE ####
DB_DRIVER=YOUR_DRIVER
DB_HOST=YOUR_HOST
DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
DB_USER=YOUR_USER
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
DB_PORT=YOUR_PORT

#### SUPPORT MODE ####
STANDARD_MODE=false

#### ENCRYPTY KEY ####
ENCRYPT=

#### MAILER SETTINGS ####
MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=no-reply@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Monolog System"
```

### 6. Build the front-end assets

Once NPM packages are installed, you can build the front-end assets by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will compile your assets, including Tailwind CSS, and make them ready for use.

### 7. Start the development server

Use the following command to start the server:

```bash
php mono.php server
```

This command will launch the built-in PHP server using the port defined in your `.env` file. By default, it uses port `8000`.

### 8. Create layouts and other components

You can create layouts, controllers, models, migrations, and other components using the following commands:

- **Create a new layout**:

```bash
php mono.php make:layout <layout-name>
```

- **Create a new controller**:

```bash
php mono.php make:controller <controller-name>
```

- **Create a new model**:

```bash
php mono.php make:model <model-name>
```

- **Create a new migration**:

```bash
php mono.php make:migration <migration-name>
```

- **Create a new view**:

```bash
php mono.php make:view <view-name>
```

- **Create a new seeder**:

```bash
php mono.php make:seeder <seeder-name>
```

---

## üöÄ How to Code

1. **Controllers**: Store your controllers in the `/src/app/controllers` directory. You can generate them using the `make:controller` command.
2. **Models**: Create models in `/src/app/models`. Use the `make:model` command for automatic generation.
3. **Migrations**: Define your database structure using migrations. Generate them with `make:migration`.
4. **Views**: All views are stored in `/resources/views`. You can create views with `make:view` or create layouts that are used globally.
5. **Layouts**: Use layouts for structuring the HTML template of your application. These can be created using the `make:layout` command.

You can easily extend and modify any part of this framework to meet your project's needs.

# Monolog - Basic CRUD Example

## Introduction
This document provides a basic implementation of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for a `User` model using the `Model` class. The `User` model extends `Model`, leveraging its built-in database methods.

## Prerequisites
- PHP 8+
- PDO Extension enabled
- A properly configured database connection

## User Model Implementation
Create a `User` model that extends `Model` use cli php mono.php make:model <name>:

```php
class User extends Model {
    protected string $tbname = 'users';
}
```

## CRUD Operations

### 1. Create a User
```php
$user = new User();
$created = $user->create([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john.doe@example.com',
    'password' => password_hash('secret', PASSWORD_BCRYPT)
]);

if ($created) {
    echo "User created successfully!";
}
```

### 2. Retrieve All Users
```php
$user = new User();
$users = $user->all();
print_r($users);
```

### 3. Find a User by ID
```php
$user = new User();
$foundUser = $user->find(1);
print_r($foundUser);
```

### 4. Update a User
```php
$user = new User();
$updated = $user->update(1, [
    'name' => 'John Updated',
    'email' => 'john.updated@example.com'
]);

if ($updated) {
    echo "User updated successfully!";
}
```

### 5. Delete a User
```php
$user = new User();
$deleted = $user->delete(1);

if ($deleted) {
    echo "User deleted successfully!";
}
```

## Conclusion
This example demonstrates how to implement a basic CRUD system using the `Model` class. You can extend this functionality by adding additional methods and refining validations.
